# V1 Checkpoint Backup - Working Status Update Flow

## Overview
This backup documents the working state of the AI agent platform after fixing the status update and Progress Indicator functionality.

## Key Components

### Frontend
- `ContentGenerationDialog.tsx`: Triggers content generation
- `GenerationProgress.tsx`: Shows generation progress based on agent status
- `AgentView.tsx`: Main view displaying agent status and progress

### Backend
- `routes.ts`: Handles `/api/agents/:id/generate` endpoint with correct status flow
- Content Generation Flow:
  1. Update agent status to "researching"
  2. Send success response
  3. Start content generation process
  4. Update status on completion/error

## Status Update Flow
1. Frontend sends generation request
2. Backend immediately updates status to "researching"
3. Frontend shows Progress Indicator due to status change
4. Backend starts content generation
5. Status updates continue through generation process

## Important Changes
The key fix that made the status update work:
1. Status update happens BEFORE starting generation
2. Response sent immediately after status update
3. Generation process runs after sending response
4. Proper error handling updates status on failure

## Database Schema
Current database schema remains unchanged with proper status tracking in the agents table.

## How to Restore
To restore to this version:
1. Use Git to revert to this commit
2. Key files to check:
   - server/routes.ts (status update flow)
